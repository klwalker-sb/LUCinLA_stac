This guide focuses on setup details specific to the computing environment available to us at UC Santa Barbara and is mostly geared toward students with little to no experience with High-Performance Computing who need to quickly jump into data processing. While the computing environment is quite specific, the more general framework for ingesting, processing, and checking large quantities of imagery using primarily open-source resources could be of interest to others with similar computing resources.
