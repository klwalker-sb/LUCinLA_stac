# Project background
================================================================================================================================

LUCinLA provides a framework and tools to synthesize large quantities of satellite imagery from multiple sensors to generate modereate- to high-resolution (~10m) landcover maps focused on agriculture/vegetation.
Our projects involve large study areas but small units-of-analysis (field sizes are often <2ha). We are often interested in changes across decades of annualy dynamic landcover classes such as crops (often with different rotations between and within years), thus requiring both a long and dense time-series stack.

Current LUCinLA projects in Robert Heilmayr's Conservation Economics Lab (CEL) include:
* A NASA-funded grant on property values and land-use change in Paraguay and Uruguay:  The supporting map, produced by the procedure outlined in this guide, will be a high-resolution maps of fields, identified to crop-type, across a large region spanning Paraguay and Uruguay (focusing on the Pampas, Chaco, and Alto Parana Atlantic Forest regions).
* Forest mapping in Chile, to assess the effect of payments to private landowners on forest cover (and forest type in terms of natural vs. plantation) and ultimately carbon stocks.

 The framework outlined in this guide enables large quantities of satellite data to be ingested and processed to generate carefully calibrated, gap-filled weekly time-series data over the entire study region at 10m resolution.
